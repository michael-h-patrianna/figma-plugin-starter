# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Figma Plugin Starter

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Figma Plugin Starter project. The goal of this project is to provide a robust, modern, and feature-rich template for developers to build their own Figma plugins. It includes a wide array of pre-built UI components, services for common plugin tasks, and a solid architectural foundation.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Theming System

-   **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to switch between a light and dark theme for the plugin's UI so that it can match my preference or the Figma UI theme.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The plugin UI must support both a "light" and a "dark" theme.
    -   A theme toggle control must be available in the UI, for example, within a settings menu.
    -   The selected theme (light or dark) must be applied instantly across the entire plugin UI.
    -   All standard UI components (buttons, inputs, text, backgrounds, etc.) must have distinct styles for both themes.
    -   The user's theme preference must be saved and automatically applied the next time the plugin is launched.
    -   The `body` element of the document should have a `data-theme` attribute reflecting the current theme.

### 2.2. Persistent Settings

-   **User Story:** As a user, I want the plugin to remember my settings (like theme preference or other choices) so that I don't have to reconfigure it every time I open it.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The plugin must provide a mechanism to store user settings.
    -   Settings should be loaded when the plugin starts.
    -   Any changes to settings during a session must be saved automatically.
    -   Saved settings must persist between plugin launches.
    -   The settings system should be easily extendable to include new options.
    -   The `useSettings` hook should abstract away the complexities of loading and saving.

### 2.3. Debug Mode

-   **User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to enable a "debug mode" that provides additional information and tools to help me troubleshoot the plugin.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   A toggle for enabling/disabling debug mode must be available in the UI (e.g., in a settings menu).
    -   When enabled, a dedicated Debug Panel must become visible in the UI.
    -   The Debug Panel should display relevant state information, logs, or other debugging data.
    -   The state of the debug mode (enabled/disabled) must be a persistent setting.
    -   The debug mode state should be synchronized between the UI thread and the main plugin thread.

### 2.4. UI Component Library

-   **User Story:** As a developer, I want access to a comprehensive library of pre-built and styled UI components so that I can build a professional-looking plugin UI quickly and consistently.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The plugin must include a variety of common UI components, including but not limited to:
        -   Buttons (primary, secondary, etc.)
        -   Inputs (text, number)
        -   Dropdowns
        -   Checkboxes and Radio Buttons
        -   Toggles
        -   Tabs
        -   Modals and Dialogs
        -   Toast Notifications
        -   Progress Bars
        -   Spinners/Loaders
        -   Accordions
        -   Data Tables / Grids
    -   All components must be themeable (support light and dark modes).
    -   Components should be organized logically in the codebase (e.g., under `src/ui/components`).
    -   The main UI should include a demonstration or view for each component category (e.g., Forms, Content, Modals).

### 2.5. Help & Guidance System

-   **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to access help and information about the plugin's functionality directly within the plugin.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   A clearly visible help icon (e.g., a floating "?") must be present in the UI.
    -   Clicking the help icon must open a help dialog or panel (`HelpPopup`).
    -   The help content should be easy to update and manage.
    -   The help dialog must be dismissible.

### 2.6. Notification System (Toasts)

-   **User Story:** As a user, I want to receive non-intrusive feedback on the outcome of my actions, such as success, failure, or warnings.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The plugin must have a toast notification system.
    -   It must support different levels of notifications: success, error, warning, and info.
    -   A `ToastService` should be available to easily trigger notifications from anywhere in the UI code.
    -   Notifications should appear for a limited time and then automatically disappear.
    -   A global container (`GlobalToastContainer`) must be present to manage the display of toasts.

### 2.7. Asynchronous Operation Handling

-   **User Story:** As a user, when I trigger a long-running task, I want to see a progress indicator so I know the plugin is working and hasn't frozen.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   For potentially long-running operations (e.g., scanning the document), a progress overlay must be displayed.
    -   The overlay should block further UI interaction to prevent inconsistent states.
    -   A `ProgressBar` component within the overlay must show the progress of the operation.
    -   The overlay must disappear once the operation is complete.
    -   The system should be able to simulate progress for demonstration purposes.

### 2.8. Lazy Loading for UI Views

-   **User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to load efficiently, without a long startup time, even if it has many complex views.

-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   UI views that are not immediately visible (e.g., content of non-active tabs) should be lazy-loaded.
    -   A `LazyLoader` component must be used to implement this behavior.
    -   A loading indicator should be displayed while a lazy-loaded component is being fetched.

## 3. Plugin-Specific Functionality
